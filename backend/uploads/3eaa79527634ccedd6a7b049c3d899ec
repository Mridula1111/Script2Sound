Feature scaling is a preprocessing technique that transforms feature values to a similar scale,
ensuring all features contribute equally to the model. It’s essential for datasets with features of
varying ranges, units, or magnitudes. Common techniques include standardization,
normalization, and min-max scaling. This process improves model performance, convergence,
and prevents bias from features with larger values.

What is scaling in data analysis?
Scaling refers to transforming the range of values for features in a dataset to a common scale,
often between 0-1 or -1 to 1.

This is an important data preparation technique in machine learning and data analysis for
several reasons:
1. Prevents bias from variables with larger ranges: Features with wider ranges can dominate the
outcome of certain algorithms. Scaling puts all features on the same footing.
2. Improves convergence of optimization algorithms: Algorithms like gradient descent converge
faster when features are scaled.
3. Enables use of regularization techniques: Regularization methods often assume features take
small values. Scaling allows effective use of techniques like L1 and L2 regularization.
4. Standardizes data: Puts data from different sources on a common scale for meaningful
comparison.
